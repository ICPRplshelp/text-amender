(I know that I forgot the square root in the demo equation. My memory was short)

## Known issues

Some keywords produced by MS Word may not be supported in LaTeX. If so, file an issue telling me so I can patch them.

Note that if you want to put math like this on Github, change `\begin{align*}` to `\begin{aligned}` and put it INSIDE math mode. You may also need to replace all instances of `\{` and `\}` with `\lbrace` and `\rbrace`.
